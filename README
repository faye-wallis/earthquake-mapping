ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: 
We sourced our data from a kaggle dataset published by Elizabeth Degroot (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elizabethdgroot/volcanoevents02021/data) and used openstreetmap.org to help visualize our data. The use of this data is intended for educational purposes and we acknowledge that it may also contain data inaccuracies, outdated info, and biases due to reporting limitations.  
 
OVERVIEW: 
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive map which can be used to explore volcano data from 0 A.D. to 2020 A.D. It can be filtered to show eruptions during any span of time within this interval, and its' multiple layers allow the user to explore the relationships between explosivity/mortality, and volcano type/tsunami creation.

DATA SOURCES: 
Volcano data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elizabethdgroot/volcanoevents02021/data 
Map: https://www.openstreetmap.org 

INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the filter at the top of the screen to select which time frame you would like to examine. The map has three layers: Volcanic Info, Volcanic Deaths, and Volcanic Tsunamis. Clicking on any marker within these layers will reveal more information about that eruption. 

Volcanic Info has information on all details of each volcano, while Volcanic Deaths and Volcanic Tsunamis are tailored to examine specific intersections of volcanic activity.

Volcanic Deaths highlights the relationship between VEI (Volcanic Explosivity Index) and the fatality rate of each eruption. The size of each marker is based on the eruption's VEI, and the color is based on the eruption's death toll.

In Volcanic Tsunamis, the marker for any eruption which led to a tsunami is colored blue, and the associated popup will display that volcano's geological type, allowing the user to observe which volcano types are most often associated with tsunamis.
